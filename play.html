        <h4 class="judge">JUDGE.</h3> 
        <p class="direction">[_Irritated, puts the card back in its place, and turns upon the_
            VAIN WOMAN _crossly_.]
        </p>
        <p class="speaking"> I fear that I cannot please you and I do not have
            time to----
        </p>
          <h4 class="imp">IMP.</h4>
        <p class="direction">[_Interrupts and runs over to the railing, speaking soothingly to
            the_ JUDGE.] 
        </p>
        <p class="speaking">
            Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the lady would like deafness in
            exchange for her wrinkles. Deafness wouldn't show, so it couldn't spoil
            her face or her elegant figure.
        </p>
            <h4 class="judge">JUDGE. </h4>
        <p class="speaking">[_Wearily._] No, it won't show. Deafness ought to be a good thing
            for you.
        </p>
            <h4 class="vain-woman">VAIN WOMAN. </h4>
            <p class="speaking">[_Consideringly._] Why--yes--that might do. But--well, it
            wouldn't show. I've a notion to take it. [_Pause--she seems to consider
            and meditate. The_ JUDGE _stares at her coldly_. IMP _grins impudently.
            She rises leisurely, sighs._] All right. I'll accept it.
        </p>
            
            <h4 class="judge">JUDGE. </h4>
            <p class="speaking">[_Sharply._] Hold up your right hand. </p>
            <p class="direction"> [_She raises hand._]</p>
            <p class="speaking"> Do you swear to accept deafness for better or for worse, as your portion of the
            world's miseries, so help you God?
            </p>
            <h4 class="vain-woman">VAIN WOMAN. </h4>
            <p class="speaking">[_Sweetly._] Oh, yes. I do, Judge.</p>
            
        <h4 class="judge">JUDGE. </h4> 
        <p class="speaking">[_To_ IMP.] Show the lady to the changing-room.</p>
