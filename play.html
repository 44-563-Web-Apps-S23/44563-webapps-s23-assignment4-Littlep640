        <h3>THE EXCHANGE Author - Althea Thurston</h3>
        <p>JUDGE. [_Irritated, puts the card back in its place, and turns upon the_
            VAIN WOMAN _crossly_.] I fear that I cannot please you and I do not have
            time to----
            
            IMP. [_Interrupts and runs over to the railing, speaking soothingly to
            the_ JUDGE.] Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the lady would like deafness in
            exchange for her wrinkles. Deafness wouldn't show, so it couldn't spoil
            her face or her elegant figure.
            
            JUDGE. [_Wearily._] No, it won't show. Deafness ought to be a good thing
            for you.
            
            VAIN WOMAN. [_Consideringly._] Why--yes--that might do. But--well, it
            wouldn't show. I've a notion to take it. [_Pause--she seems to consider
            and meditate. The_ JUDGE _stares at her coldly_. IMP _grins impudently.
            She rises leisurely, sighs._] All right. I'll accept it.
            
            JUDGE. [_Sharply._] Hold up your right hand. [_She raises hand._] Do you
            swear to accept deafness for better or for worse, as your portion of the
            world's miseries, so help you God?
            
            VAIN WOMAN. [_Sweetly._] Oh, yes. I do, Judge.
            
            JUDGE. [_To_ IMP.] Show the lady to the changing-room.
